# Selfoss-WF Docker
 A docker file to create an image for Selfoss & Webfront
 
 The main branch is based on the released version of Selfoss (currently 2.18), while the dev branch is using the latest changes as it clones the git repo from Selfoss.

## How-to
- Clone it to your disk
- Run `docker build . -t selfoss-wf:latest`

This should create the image on your machine and based on your architecture.
